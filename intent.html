            <h4>The Bombay Scottish School has excelled, for over 169 years, in providing fine education, to the pupils entrusted to its care. In these years that have gone by, the School endeavored kindling a fire in the young minds of its pupils, preparing them for a world of tomorrow, full of challenges, so that in the words of Plato â€˜they may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.â€™

                The School follows the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) up to the tenth grade and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) for the eleventh and twelfth grades. The School encourages the pupils to inculcate the two qualities which symbolize the Scottish character, achieving success by means of honest and strenuous effort and placing complete faith in God.

                The School pays special attention to needs of students with learning difficulties through sustained attention provided by specially trained staff. The student body of 3300 boys and girls is divided into four Houses viz Yellow House, Green House, Red House and Blue House. The boysâ€™ houses Haddow, Kennedy, MacPherson and MacGregor are named after Scottish missionaries who were closely associated with the Orphanage; The girlsâ€™ houses are named after the Scottish queens Anne, Victoria, Catherine and Elizabeth.</h4>

        <h4>School History
            The formation of Bombay Scottish School began in 1847 when the Scottish Christian missionaries established the â€˜Scottish Female Orphanageâ€™ at Byculla, for benefit of the daughters of Presbyterian soldiers and Indian Navy Seamen. The success of this first institution led to the establishment of the â€˜Orphanage for the Sons of Presbyteriansâ€™ in 1856. These two humble institutions were united in 1859 under the name of the â€˜Bombay Presbyterian Male and Female Orphanageâ€™. The name was changed in 1863 to the â€˜Bombay Scottish Orphanageâ€™.

            In 1867, a society with its own constitution, and rules and regulations, was formed. A new constitution was adopted in 1886 and since then the Society is known as the â€˜Bombay Scottish Orphanage Societyâ€™. With the principal objective of equipping the children to take their place in the society, a large plot of land was acquired on the beautiful Mahim Bay. The Government of Bombay in 1875 approved construction of the boarding school building designed by D E Gostling, F R I B A and J Morris. The construction of the building commenced on 8th December 1875 by his Excellency, the Honourable Sir Philip Edmond Wodehouse, the then Governor and President in Council and was completed on 28th February 1878, at a cost of Rs 84,015. The facility was opened to use by his Excellency, the Hon. Sir Richard Temple Bart, G C S I the then Governor and President in Council.

            In the early years the student strength was a mere 30 odd. As classes were added and the standard of education effectively upgraded, the Orphanage was elevated to the position of a high school and went by the name â€˜The Bombay Scottish Orphanage High Schoolâ€™. When the Orphanage was closed down its name was changed to â€˜The Bombay Scottish Schoolâ€™.
